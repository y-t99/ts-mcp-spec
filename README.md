## MCP

> Protocol Revision: 2024-11-05

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether youâ€™re building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.

This specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the TypeScript schema in [schema.ts](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/blob/main/schema/2024-11-05/schema.ts).
